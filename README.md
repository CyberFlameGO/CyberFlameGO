### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm **CyberFlameGO**, but people call me **Cyber**. My *name* is **Aaron**, my _pronouns_ are **he/him**, and I'm currently a **student**. I enjoy gaming and am very interested in digital technologies. I practically live on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/218977195375329281), am very interested in the platform, and moderate a couple communities there too. I play Minecraft pretty often too.

>Forking is my passion. What are stars? Never heard of 'em. All my *own* repositories for **this account** are here: [https://github.com/CyberFlameGO?tab=repositories&type=source](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO?tab=repositories&type=source)

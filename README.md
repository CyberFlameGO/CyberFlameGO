### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm __CyberFlameGO__, but people call me **Cyber**. My *name* is **Aaron**, my _pronouns_ are **he/him**, and I'm currently a **student**. I enjoy gaming and am very interested in digital technologies (and psychology/similar fields, though irrelevant). I'm extremely frequently on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/218977195375329281) \([cyberflameu](discord://-/users/218977195375329281)\), am quite interested in the platform, and moderate a couple communities on it, as well as hunt bugs. I play Minecraft pretty often too, which is why a fair amount of my repositories are related to the game. 

To contact me, you can flick me a DM on Discord, email me with [cyberflameu@gmail.com](mailto:cyberflameu@gmail.com), or create an [issue](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/CyberFlameGO/issues/new/)/[discussion](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/CyberFlameGO/discussions/new) outlining what you need (these are public though).

> I'm well aware of how many repositories I appear to have; forking is pretty much starring to me, so **98%** (not calculated) of all my forks are just because I like the project, not because I have actual work on them; I do contribute to quite a few of my forked projects though. Most of my *own* repositories for **this account** are here: [https://github.com/CyberFlameGO?tab=repositories&type=source](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO?tab=repositories&type=source)

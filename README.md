### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am **Cyber**, and I'm currently a **university student**, studying computer science, psychology, and brain sciences & mental health. My main hobbyist programming relates to Discord and Minecraft as platforms, which is (at the time of writing) seen in my pinned repositories. 
I'm very reachable on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/218977195375329281) \([cyberflameu](discord://-/users/218977195375329281)\) - to contact me, feel free to add me and flick me a DM there, or email me at [cyberflameu@gmail.com](mailto:cyberflameu@gmail.com), or create an [issue](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/CyberFlameGO/issues/new/)/[discussion](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/CyberFlameGO/discussions/new) outlining what you need (although GitHub's issues/discussions are publicly viewable).

> I have a bunch of stale forks from not starring repositories - to see *most* of my actual repositories you can select the 'Sources' type when viewing the repositories on my profile (or use [this link](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=) to avoid a few clicks)

### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am **Cyber**, a university student studying at [Te Herenga Waka â€” Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/), New Zealand. I'm doing a **BSc** in *Computer Science*, conjointly with a **BPsyc** in *Psychology* and *Brain Sciences & Mental Health*. My main hobbyist programming relates to Discord and Minecraft as platforms, which is (at the time of writing) seen in my pinned repositories. 
I'm very reachable on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/218977195375329281) \([cyberflameu](discord://-/users/218977195375329281)\) - to contact me, feel free to add me and flick me a DM there, or email me at [cyberflameu@gmail.com](mailto:cyberflameu@gmail.com). Alternatively, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/CyberFlameGO/issues/new/)/[discussion](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/CyberFlameGO/discussions/new) outlining what you need as I have notifications enabled for those two mediums (although GitHub's issues/discussions are publicly viewable).

> I have a bunch of stale forks which can be considered equal to starring repositories for the purposes of viewing my profile - to see *most* of my actual repositories you can select the 'Sources' type when viewing the repositories on my profile (or use [this link](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=) to avoid a few clicks)
